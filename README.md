# CAmap Nordic & Baltic

**Interactive map of TLS certificate authority sovereignty for Nordic municipalities**

Inspired by [mxmap.ch](https://mxmap.ch) (David Huser) — where mxmap shows email providers,
CAmap shows **which certificate authority controls HTTPS** for each municipality website and
what "kill-switch" risk that implies.

## Demonstrative purpose

> **This application is a demonstration tool, not an operational risk assessment.**

Municipal public websites are rarely mission-critical. An outage on `espoo.fi` is an
inconvenience; it does not stop an ambulance, disable a water treatment plant or block a
hospital's patient records system.

The real significance of this map lies in what it *suggests*: **the CA choices visible on
public-facing websites are a reliable proxy for the procurement and infrastructure practices
of the same organisations.** Municipalities that rely on US-controlled certificate authorities
for their public websites very likely apply the same procurement patterns across their internal
systems — including IT infrastructure used by hospitals, emergency dispatch, social services and
utilities. Those systems often share the same cloud vendors, the same managed DNS providers and,
consequently, the same certificate authorities.

The US CLOUD Act grants American authorities the power to compel any US-headquartered company
to produce data or — in the case of a CA — to revoke or withhold certificates, regardless of
where the data or service is physically located. A municipality that has unknowingly embedded
US-controlled PKI throughout its infrastructure has created a structural dependency that could,
in an extreme scenario, be leveraged against the continuity of its services.

This map is an invitation to ask the question: if our public website certificate is US-controlled,
what else is? It is a starting point for a broader audit of digital sovereignty in the public
sector.

### Conflict of interest disclosure

The author, **Mikko Koljander**, has a direct professional interest in the subject matter of this
application. He is involved in certificate authority product development and operations at
[Telia](https://support.trust.telia.com/index_en.html), a Nordic telecommunications company whose CA services
(Telia Certificate Service) are classified in this map as **Minimal risk / Nordic jurisdiction**.

This disclosure is made in the interest of transparency. The data collection methodology, the
CA classification database and the risk taxonomy are based on verifiable public information
(certificate chain inspection, CCADB, DNS records) and apply the same criteria to all CAs
including Telia. The author's professional background informs the technical design of the
scanner but does not alter the classification results, which are derived automatically from
certificate data.

Readers are encouraged to inspect the open source code, reproduce the scan results
independently and raise any concerns via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/koldex/ca-sovereignty-map/issues).

## What it shows

A certificate authority (CA) that has issued a TLS certificate can revoke it or refuse to
renew it. If that CA is headquartered in the US it is subject to the **CLOUD Act**, meaning
a US court order could compel it to act against any municipality's certificate. This project
maps that exposure across ~1 313 municipalities in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

### Risk levels

| Level | Colour | Description | Example CAs |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Critical | 🔴 Red | US CLOUD Act, direct revocation risk | DigiCert, Amazon, Google |
| High | 🟠 Orange-red | US jurisdiction, nonprofit | Let's Encrypt (ISRG) |
| Medium | 🟡 Orange | Allied non-EU or multinational | GlobalSign (BE/JP) |
| Low | 🔵 Blue | EU-controlled | HARICA (GR), Certum (PL) |
| Minimal | 🟢 Green | Nordic / national | Buypass (NO), Telia (SE) |
| Unknown | ⬜ Grey | No HTTPS or unrecognised CA | — |

## Architecture

### Three-phase pipeline

```
Phase 1  resolve-domains
         Wikidata SPARQL + domain guessing + DNS validation
         → municipality_domains.json (884 entries)

Phase 2  scan-certs
         asyncio SSL scan + DNS CAA probe + crt.sh CT logs
         → data.json + data.min.json

Phase 3  analyze
         Statistics: CA distribution, per-country breakdown
         → stdout report
```

### Key design decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **asyncio SSL** as primary TLS scanner | OpenSSL subprocess timed out for ~40% of servers; asyncio handles SNI/ALPN natively |
| **www fallback** in scanner | ~10% of certs are only on the www subdomain |
| **GISCO LAU 2021** for boundaries | Single authoritative source for FI+SE+NO+DK at municipality level |
| **Weighted evidence aggregation** | Same pattern as mxmap: leaf (0.35) + inter (0.25) + root (0.15) + CAA (0.10) + CT (0.08) |
| **GitHub Pages** hosting | Free, simple; data files ≤2 MB fit well |
| **Pydantic frozen models** | Immutable data throughout the pipeline prevents accidental mutation |

## Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- Node.js + npx (for TopoJSON generation only)
- Python 3.12+

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koldex/ca-sovereignty-map
cd ca-sovereignty-map
uv sync --group dev
```

### Run the full pipeline

```bash
# Phase 1: resolve municipality domains (~8 minutes, DNS lookups)
uv run python scripts/bootstrap_domains.py

# Phase 2: scan TLS certificates (~15 minutes, 884 domains, concurrency 30)
uv run scan-certs --skip-ct --concurrency 30

# Phase 3: statistics report
uv run analyze
```

### Regenerate municipality boundaries

Only needed when GISCO data is updated or countries change:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_topojson.py
# Downloads ~125 MB GISCO file to .data_cache/, outputs 614 KB TopoJSON
```

### Run tests

```bash
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run ruff format src tests
```

## Self-Hosting

### Option 1 — GitHub Pages (simplest)

Fork the repository and enable Pages from `Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
→ Source: GitHub Actions`. The nightly workflow (`nightly.yml`) runs `scan-certs`
and publishes the freshly generated `data.json` / `data.min.json` straight to Pages
via `actions/deploy-pages`; nothing is committed back to `main`.

The repo-tracked `data.json` / `data.min.json` act as a *baseline* — the version
served on the first Pages deploy and any time a developer needs to reproduce a
snapshot locally. Updates to that baseline flow through the normal signed-commit
PR workflow (`docs/branching.md`); the nightly automation only refreshes the
live site.

### Option 2 — UpCloud Helsinki + Coolify (~7 €/month)

Recommended for full sovereignty — Finnish jurisdiction, no US CLOUD Act exposure.

```bash
# 1. Create UpCloud server (Helsinki, Developer Plan)
#    OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

# 2. Install Coolify (open-source Vercel alternative)
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash

# 3. In Coolify UI (https://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000):
#    - New project → Connect GitHub repo
#    - Set build command: npm ci && npm run build  (or static file serving)
#    - Set domain + SSL (use Telia ACME for Nordic/Swedish jurisdiction)
```

### Option 3 — UpCloud Object Storage (~3 €/month, static only)

```bash
# Build static site
npm run build   # or just serve the repo root

# Sync to UpCloud Object Storage (Helsinki)
aws s3 sync . s3://camap-nordics/ \
    --endpoint-url https://fi-hel2.upcloudobjects.com \
    --exclude ".git/*" --exclude ".data_cache/*"
```

### GitHub Actions secrets needed for automated hosting

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `UPCLOUD_S3_ACCESS` | UpCloud Object Storage access key |
| `UPCLOUD_S3_SECRET` | UpCloud Object Storage secret key |

Store these in `Settings → Secrets → Actions` in your fork. Never commit them to the repo.

### TLS certificate for self-hosted deployment

For maximum sovereignty, use **Telia Certificate Service** (Swedish CA, Nordic jurisdiction)
instead of Let's Encrypt (US CLOUD Act). Telia offers publicly trusted DV and OV TLS
certificates via ACME from their FullSSL self-service platform.

**ACME directory:** `https://acme.trust.telia.com/directory`

#### Prerequisites

1. Sign a FullSSL service agreement with Telia at [telia.fi/ssl](https://telia.fi/ssl)
2. After onboarding, log in to the Secure Manager self-service portal and create an
   **EAB (Extended Account Binding) credential pair** — a `KID` and an `HMAC` key.
   These replace the normal ACME account registration step.

#### Obtaining a certificate with `lego` (recommended client)

Telia recommends deploying `lego` as a Docker container. Example using HTTP-01 challenge
(port 80 must be reachable from the internet):

```bash
lego \
  -s https://acme.trust.telia.com/directory \
  -m admin@yourdomain.example \
  -a --eab \
  --kid  YOUR_KID_FROM_SECURE_MANAGER \
  --hmac YOUR_HMAC_FROM_SECURE_MANAGER \
  -d your.domain.example \
  --http run
```

For DNS-01 challenge (no open port 80 required), append `--dns <provider>` instead of
`--http`. Lego supports many DNS providers out of the box (Route53, Cloudflare, etc.).
See `lego dnshelp` for the full list.

#### Configuring in Coolify

In the Coolify UI, navigate to `Settings → SSL → Custom ACME` and enter:

- **ACME directory URL:** `https://acme.trust.telia.com/directory`
- **EAB KID:** your KID from the Secure Manager portal
- **EAB HMAC:** your HMAC key from the Secure Manager portal

Coolify will handle automatic renewal using the stored EAB credentials.

> **Note:** The Telia ACME service includes ACME ARI (Automatic Renewal Information)
> support, which allows Telia to push accelerated renewal windows if a certificate
> vulnerability is discovered.

## Data formats

### `data.json` structure

```json
{
  "generated": "2026-03-24T22:31:44Z",
  "total": 884,
  "counts": { "us-controlled": 399, "eu-controlled": 49, "nordic": 32, ... },
  "municipalities": {
    "FI-049": {
      "id": "FI-049",
      "name": "Espoo",
      "country": "FI",
      "domain": "espoo.fi",
      "primary_ca": "Let's Encrypt (ISRG)",
      "jurisdiction": "us",
      "risk_level": "high",
      "category": "us-controlled",
      "classification_confidence": 90.0,
      "cert_chain": [...],
      "caa_records": ["letsencrypt.org"],
      "classification_signals": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

Municipality IDs follow the format `{COUNTRY}-{LAU_ID}` matching the GISCO LAU 2021 dataset:
`FI-049`, `SE-0180`, `NO-0301`, `DK-101`.

### `overrides.json` format

```json
{
  "FI-091": { "domain": "hel.fi", "reason": "Helsinki uses hel.fi not helsinki.fi" }
}
```
